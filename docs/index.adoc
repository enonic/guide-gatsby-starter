= Gatsby starter for Enonic XP
:toc: right

NOTE: This guide requires Enonic XP 7.0.0 or later

== Introduction

This guide helps you build a site with GatsbyJS based on headless data from Enonic XP served via GraphQL API.
Instructions in this guide assume that you are familiar with Gatsby and Enonic XP frameworks and have basic understanding
of the Headless CMS concept. It will also help if you have some hands-on experience with GraphQL to be able to understand
and write simple queries for fetching data.

Here are some useful links to fill in the blanks:

== Set up Enonic XP

Before we start building a Gatsby site, we need a data source. In our case data will be stored in Enonic XP and delivered
to the client via GraphQL endpoint.

To set up Enonic XP environment, follow instructions in the
https://developer.enonic.com/templates/headless-cms/[Headless CMS Starter,window=_blank].
You can stop at "Accessing the API" section since this is sufficient to continue with this guide.

NOTE: We assume that you choose suggested name `com.example.myproject` for your project.

Double-check that everything is set up correctly and the project is deployed into a sandbox running at least XP 7.0.0, by
http://localhost:8080/site/default/draft/hmdb/api[clicking here,window=_blank] to make sure that GraphQL endpoint is working fine.

If you see GraphQL playground on your browser page like on the screenshot below then your XP environment is up and running, ready
to deliver headless content.

== Set up Gatsby

Follow instructions in https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/["Set Up Your Development Environment",window=_blank] chapter of
the Gatsby tutorial to install prerequisites for Gatsby environment. After that you should have `Node.js`, `Git` an `Gatsby CLI`
installed locally.

WARNING: Pause when you have reached the "_Create a Gatsby site_" section of the Gatsby tutorial and read the tips underneath.

TIP: Gatsby tutorial suggests that you use `gatsby-starter-hello-world` as a starter for your new site. This is fine if
you are learning how to build up a new Gatsby site from scratch, but for our guide we will use a more advanced `gatsby-starter-default`
that adds styling, support for SEO, Web manifest and extendable config which we will need to add the Enonic plugin.

So, when you are ready to create a new Gatsby site, run this command in your terminal:

    gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

TIP: When the site wizard asks you which package manager you would like to use for your new site, select *NPM*

Once you've successfully created your first "Hello World" Gatsby site, you can start Gatsby development server locally
by executing `gatsby develop` in your terminal window.

image::images/guide-3.png["Start Gatsby development server", width="554px"]

After that you will have Gatsby server running on port 8000 while Enonic XP is running on port 8080.

http://localhost:8000/[Click here,window=_blank] to make sure that your Gatsby site is up and running.

Now let's make Gatsby and Enonic XP communicate with each other!


== Headless data

If you have read through the https://developer.enonic.com/templates/headless-cms/[Headless CMS Starter,window=_blank] guide,
you already know that an XP application based on the Headless CMS Starter creates a site called "_Headless Movie Database_", which
contains some sample data about Movies and Persons (actors and directors).

If you have installed Content Studio app in your XP environment, you can see the site there:

image::images/guide-5.png["Headless Movie Database site in Content Studio", width="768px"]

Normally, if you'd want to use Enonic XP to render the list of movies or persons on a site, you would have to set up a
page template and page controller, plug in template renderer and XP libraries, in other words do a lot of quite advanced development.

*The purpose of this guide* is to describe how you can configure Enonic plugin for Gatsby to generate pages with movie
and person lists (as well as dedicated details page for every movie/person) without any coding in Enonic XP whatsoever.
The only advanced thing you need to master is how to write a proper query to retrieve the data you want to render on your site pages.

=== GraphQL queries

Before you start using the plugin, it's important that you understand how to fetch data from Enonic XP with GraphQL. The Headless
CMS starter already provides necessary GraphQL schema generation for you, so the only thing you need to do is write correct queries.

NOTE: *New to GraphQL?* Check out the https://graphql.org[GraphQL documentation,window=_blank].

In this guide we will use two prepared queries, one to retrieve _Movies_ and another to retrieve _Persons_. For your own data the queries
will obviously be different, so make sure you get acquainted with GraphQL before building your own Gatsby site.

TIP: You can use GraphQL playground of the http://localhost:8080/site/default/draft/hmdb/api[API endpoint,window=_blank] to write and test queries.

First, let's write a query to retrieve movies:

.A query to fetch movies:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes: "com.example.myproject:movie", query: "valid='true'", sort: "displayName") {
      id: _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----

image::images/guide-6.png["GraphQL query to retrieve movies", width="929px"]

NOTE: As you already know from the Headless CMS guide, API in the Headless Starter is provided
by the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine-app[Guillotine project,window=_blank],
therefore each query is wrapped inside `guillotine {}` field.

Note that we pass `contentTypes` parameter to the query to fetch content only of specific type `com.example.myproject:movie`,
where `com.example.myproject` is your application name (the one you chose when creating an XP project with CLI).

The other two parameters of the query are `query: "valid='true'"` (to filter out items that don't have all of the mandatory fields filled out)
and `sort: "displayName"` (to sort the list by name).

This query retrieves the very minimum of fields from the movie content type needed to output the list: `id` and `displayName`.

Note that fields specific to this content type has to be casted with `... on com_example_myproject_Movie` where you again
have to use your application name.

Here's the second query that fetches content of "persons" content type:

.A query to fetch persons:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes: "com.example.myproject:person", query: "valid='true'", sort: "displayName") {
      id: _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----

image::images/guide-7.png["GraphQL query to retrieve persons", width="1343px"]


This query is very similar to the first one, except we are requesting content of `com.example.myproject:person` content type.

We will use both these queries when we start configuring the Gatsby plugin, but it's important that you get both
to actually return some data in the GraphQL playground and understand how they work.

== Enonic plugin for Gatsby

Enonic plugin for Gatsby provides automatic generation of static pages based on data fetched by GraphQL queries. Data
fetching and page generation happen _build-time_ which means that when user browses the site he's browsing _static_ pages,
with no data being requested at run-time, resulting in extremely fast page load time.

If you have read through the https://developer.enonic.com/templates/headless-cms/[Headless CMS Starter,window=_blank] guide,
you already know that an XP application based on the Headless CMS Starter creates a site called "_Headless Movie Database_", which
contains some sample data about Movies and Persons (actors and directors).

If you have installed Content Studio app in your XP environment, you can see the site there:

image::images/guide-5.png["Headless Movie Database site in Content Studio", width="768px"]

In this guide we will configure the Enonic plugin to generate static pages listing all movies and persons, as well as dedicated
page for every movie and person.

=== Install Enonic plugin

You can temporarily stop Gatsby server while we'll be configuring the plugin (note that this will take down the site).

Go to your Gatsby site folder and run the following command in the terminal window:

    npm install gatsby-plugin-enonic

This will download `gatsby-plugin-enonic` from NPM and add dependency to `package.json` file inside the project.

=== Configure Enonic plugin

Open the site project ("_hello-world_") in IDE/code editor of your choice (look for inspiration https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#set-up-a-code-editor[here,window=_blank] if you are unsure)

.Hello World project structure:
[source,files]
----
HELLO-WORLD
src/
  components/
  images/
  pages/
gatsby-config.js
package-lock.json
package.json
----


Open the file called _gatsby-config.js_ in the project root. Here's where you configure plugins used by the site.

==== General configuration

Add this config inside `plugins []`:

.Base plugin config
[source,JSON]
----
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-enonic`,
      options: {
        api: 'http://localhost:8080/site/default/draft/hmdb/api', <1>
        application: 'com.example.myproject', <2>
        refetchInterval: 10, <3>
      }
    },
    // other plugins here
]
----
The pages are not configured yet and the plugin is not functional since it requires at least one page definition.
But before we get to page config, let's explain the basic options:

<1> Url of the GraphQL endpoint inside a site in XP. This is where the data will be fetched from.
<2> (optional) Name of the application (the one you specify when creating a new project with Enonic CLI). This name will be
used if you are using %application% placeholder in your GraphQL queries.
<3> (optional) If you want contents of your pages to be dynamically refreshed whenever underlying data changes, you can specify
how often you want the storage to be checked for new changes (in seconds). You don't want this to be too often since a new request
will be sent to server every time to fetch the data.

Now let's start configuring the pages.

==== Listing page

At the moment of writing Enonic plugin for Gatsby supports two types of pages: `list` and `details`.

Let's configure pages with Movie and Person lists.

First, we need to create a simple template that will output the list. Since we are building a relatively simple list
showing just movie or person name (with a link to the details page), we can use the same template for both lists.


1. Create a new folder called "_templates_" in the `src` folder of your Gatsby site.

2. In `src/templates` create a file called `list.js` with the following contents:

+
.Template for the listing page
[source,javascript]
----
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import SEO from "../components/seo"

const ListPage = (args) => {
    const { pageContext } = args
    return (
      <Layout>
        <SEO title={pageContext.title || `List`} />
        <h1>{pageContext.title}</h1>
          {
              pageContext.nodes.map(node => (
                <div key={node.id}>
                    <span>{node.displayName}</span>
                </div>
          ))
          }<br/>
      </Layout>
    )
}

export default ListPage
----
+
Now, from the Gatsby tutorials you know that Gatsby operates with React components. Our listing page (`const ListPage`) is also a React component.
It takes `pageContext` argument (more about that later) which contains the list of `nodes` which are basically the result of a GraphQL
query we wrote a bit earlier in this guide. The component iterates through the array of nodes and for every node it outputs a `<div>` with unique
key (`node.id`) and an item's display name (`node.displayName`). This makes it a very basic list which can be used both for Movies and Persons.
+
The resulting list is wrapped inside `<Layout>` component which already comes with the Gatsby starter site and which injects header, footer and
applies some nice styling to the page, so that we don't have to care about it.
+
<SEO> is another component that comes with the Gatsby starter which generates various SEO tags. You don't have to use it, but it's a nice add-on.
If you pass `title` argument to it (like we did above) it will use page title in SEO tags and display specified title in the browser tab.

3. Remember the two GraphQL queries we wrote earlier in this guide to retrieve movies and persons from the database? We need to put them in a file
so that the plugin could find them.
+

4. Create a new folder called "_queries_" in the `src` folder of your Gatsby site.

5. In `src/queries` create a file called `getMovies.js` exposing the query fetching the movies:
+
.`src/queries/getMovies.js`
[source,javascript]
----
const query = `{
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes: "com.example.myproject:movie", query: "valid='true'", sort: "displayName") {
      id: _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
`

module.exports = query;
----

6. Now let's do the same for the persons query - put it in a file called `getPersons.js` in the same folder.
+
TIP: You can replace application name inside a query with `%application%` placeholder
(but make sure you defined `application` option in the plugin config). This will help you reuse the same queries in
several applications and not care about possible changes of application name.
+
.`src/queries/getPersons.js` (with placeholder)
[source,javascript]
----
const query = `{
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes: "%application%:person", query: "valid='true'", sort: "displayName") {
      id: _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}`

module.exports = query;
----
+
TIP: As mentioned before, GraphQL queries for Enonic XP have to be wrapped inside `guillotine {}` field. If you for some
reasons don't like this, you can omit it - the plugin supports both versions.
+
.`src/queries/getPersons.js` (unwrapped)
[source,javascript]
----
const query = `{
  query(contentTypes: "%application%:person", query: "valid='true'", sort: "displayName") {
    id: _id
    displayName
  }
}`

module.exports = query;
----

7. Go back to `gatsby-config.js` and add the following to our previous plugin config:
+
.Config of the listing page
[source,JSON]
----
pages: [{
  query: require.resolve('./src/queries/getMovies'),  <1>
  list: <2> {
    url: '/movies', <3>
    template: require.resolve('./src/templates/list.js'), <4>
    title: 'Movies' <5>
  }
}]
----
+
<1> A path to a Javascript file exposing a string with GraphQL query via `module.exports`
<2> A keyword indicating definition of a listing page.
<3> Url of the page. If your site is on "_localhost:8000_", this page will be on "_localhost:8000/movies_"
<4> A path to a Javascript file exposing React component rendering the list of data nodes.
<5> (optional) Title of the page, should you need to use it inside the template
+
.Full config of the plugin (so far)
[source,JSON]
----
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-enonic`,
  options: {
    api: 'http://localhost:8080/site/default/draft/hmdb/api',
    application: 'com.example.myproject',
    refetchInterval: 10,
    pages: [{
      query: require.resolve('./src/queries/getMovies'),
      list: {
        url: '/movies',
        template: require.resolve('./src/templates/list.js'),
        title: 'Movies'
      }
    }]
  }
}
----

8. Now switch to the terminal window and run `gatsby develop` in your `hello-world` folder:
+
image::images/guide-8.png["GraphQL query to retrieve persons", width="484px"]
+
If everything was configured properly, you will see something similar in the terminal window, indicating that the site is built and
Gatsby development server is ready to serve the content.
+
If you are getting errors, double-check the previous steps to make sure you didn't miss anything, that Enonic XP is up and
running on port 8080 and that syntax inside GraphQL queries and Javascript files is as explained.
+
Open the Gatsby site at http://localhost:8000[http://localhost:8000]. Visually nothing has changed since the first time we opened it after
it was created from the Gatsby starter. So how do we check the contents of our Movies page? You can either open
http://localhost:8000/movies[http://localhost:8000/movies] directly in your browser, or you can add a link to the site's main page to make
your life a bit easier.

9. Open `/src/pages/index.js`

Modify the "_Go to page 2_" link at the bottom of the page like this:

    <Link to="/movies">Open Movies/Link>

The page should be refreshed automatically and you will see this:

image::images/guide-9.png["Link to Movies from the main page", width="685px"]

Click the "Open Movies" link.

image::images/guide-10.png["Movies listing", width="393px"]

Congratulations! You have built your first Gatsby page with contents from Enonic XP.

IMPORTANT: If you make changes to a query, you have to restart the Gatsby development server (press `Ctrl+C` to stop, then `gatsby develop` again)
since the site pages have to be rebuilt from scratch to respect the new query changes.
